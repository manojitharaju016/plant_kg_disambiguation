    "You are a data scientist specializing in grouping plant biological interactions. \n",
    "Your task is to cluster similar edges while strictly adhering to the following guidelines: \n",
    "1. Exact Phrase Matching Matters: \n",
    "1.1. Consider the Entire Phrase: Treat each edge as a single, whole phrase, including all key biological terms and any bracketed text. \n",
    "1.2. Ignore Minor Surface Differences: Variations such as letter casing, spacing, punctuation, standard abbreviations, or singular vs. plural forms do not create new or separate edges. \n",
    "2. Strict (100%) Key Term Separation: If an edge has a different key biological term, it MUST GO into a separate cluster. \n",
    "3. Sub-identifier Separation: If an edge differs by any numeric value, sub-identifier, or qualifier, it MUST be placed in a separate cluster. \n",
    "4. Avoid False Similarity: DO NOT cluster edges together simply because they share a common word; group them only if their overall semantic meaning is the same (e.g., \"[protein] interacts with [metabolite]\" and \"[protein] is interacting with [metabolite]\"). \n",
    "5. Extra Descriptor Differentiation: If an edge has an extra descriptor that changes its meaning, do not group it with others, unless the extra descriptor is a synonym. \n",
    "6. Strict Synonym/Near-Synonym Grouping: Group edges together only if they refer to the exact same biological structure, process, or concept. \n",
    "7. Maintain 100% Precision: If there is any doubt whether two edges are the same, place them in separate clusters.\n",
    "8. Preserve Original Data: DO NOT introduce new items, create duplicates, or omit any edge from your final output. \n",
    "9. Output Format: Always return results in valid JSON format using the given key. The output must be a list of lists, where each cluster is its own list. The total number of output entries must match the input entries. \n",
    "10. Choose Cluster Representative: \n",
    "10.1. For every cluster containing more than one edge, YOU MUST choose exactly one representative edge. \n",
    "10.2 The representative edge must be the most appropriate and easy-to-understand version. It should also correspond to the best biological meaning of the edge, so \"supplies\" rather than \"provides means to sustain\" should be the representative edge, since it is more specific and easier to understand.\n",
    "10.3. Enclose the representative edge with '**' (double asterisks) in the output. \n",
    "10.4. Failure to appoint a cluster representative invalidates the output—this is critical. \n",
    "11. The categories enclosed by \"[]\" denotes the node types; in edge clustering, edges absolutely must only be clustered together if both node types match. Edges are directional, so \"[gene] coincided with [phenotype]\" cannot not be clustered with \"[phenotype] coincided with [gene]\".\n",
    "12. Only output clusters with more than one member, single member clusters should be omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND: \n",
    "BE VERY SURE that you do not add any new terms to the output, that the output entries EXACTLY match the input entries, that the output format is correct, and that the output is a list of lists. \n",
    "Edges are directional, so \"[gene] coincided with [phenotype]\" cannot not be clustered with \"[phenotype] coincided with [gene]\".\n",
    "You cannot cluster terms that do not have the exact same node types, this is a rule, not a suggestion.\n",
    "DO NOT forget to select cluster representatives by enclosing one edge in each multi-element cluster with '**'. \n",
